* 3-30-2017 TravisPK
    * Removed old bind stuff
    * Rearranged IP's to match Interface order

    * Made a version variable for nginix
    * Cleaned up various things and bug fixes

Notes:

	A) It should ask you the first time which interface you want it to use for lancache .
	If you want to reconfigure this at a later stage, please delete the file: /usr/local/lancache/config/interface_used

	Optional A) Monitor Through nload
		-A.1 sudo apt-get install nload -y
		-A.2 sudo nload -U G - u M -i 102400 -o 102400
	Optional B) Monitor Network Usage Through iftop
		-B.1 sudo apt-get install iftop -y
		-B.2 sudo iftop -i eth1
		Note: eth1 is the interface I've defined for lancache to use (please use it only as an example)
